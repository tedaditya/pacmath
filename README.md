# PACMATH: a pac-man like educational game

PACMATH is an educational game based on the classic arcade game Pacman. In this game, the user controls the Pacman and tries to eliminate all the ghosts. Each ghost has a number labeled on it. At the beginning of the game the Pacman needs to eat a fruit which contains a math question. The difficulty depends on the level of the game. The user needs to solve the question and eat the Ghost with the answer on it. The game proceeds to next level after all four ghosts are eliminated.

Currently the game questions contain addition, multiplication, subtraction, division and exponents. The difficulty of questions increases as the level increases. This game is targeted for elementary and secondary school students.

The game is programmed in python using the Pygame library. To run this program, the user needs to have python and Pygame installed on their computer.
